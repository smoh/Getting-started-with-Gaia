    "There are several ways to cross-match an external catalog with Gaia DR2 sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using web interface\n",
    "\n",
    "First, while it is possible to upload a catalog for querying anonymously, the web interface at the official Gaia Archive does not seem to provide this functionality. Only a list of target 'names' can be provided with the current interface (see [Using anynomous upload](#Using-anynomous-upload)).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you still prefer using the web interface to scripting:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. create an account, which grants you 1GB of user tables quota, and login.\n",
    "2. Go to Search > ADQL Tab and upload your table. It can be provided in VOTable, CSV or ASCII. Once it is uploaded, you will see it under \"User Tables\" as `user_[username].[tablename]`.\n",
    "3. You can now use this table just like any other table in the database. For example, to cross-match `user_joe.mytable` with `gaiadr2.gaia_source`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT t1.ra AS \"t1_ra\", t1.dec AS \"t1_dec\", t2.ra AS \"gaia_ra\", t2.dec AS \"gaia_dec\", ...\n",
    "FROM user_joe.mytable AS t1, gaiadr2.gaia_source AS t2\n",
    "WHERE 1 = CONTAINS(POINT('ICRS', t1.ra, t1.dec), CIRCLE('ICRS', t2.ra, t2.dec));\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NOTE**: The uploaded user tables can be edited. Check box of a table and click 'Edit table'. Specifically, you can assign RA and Dec columns, which will make those columns indexed. I suppose this may help the cross-match to be faster but I am not sure if it matters much with smaller tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NOTE**: There is also 'Cross-match tables' button, which does this query for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NOTE**: It is much faster to do\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "1 = CONTAINS(POINT(smaller_catalog), CIRCLE(larger_catalog))\n",
    "```\n",
    "than the other way around.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NOTE**: If you are planning to combine the resulting table with other tables, it can be useful to have some internal index to check unique/non-existent entries as well as merging tables. You can also do a `LEFT JOIN` instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT t1.ra AS \"t1_ra\", t1.dec AS \"t1_dec\", t2.ra AS \"gaia_ra\", t2.dec AS \"gaia_dec\", ...\n",
    "FROM user_joe.mytable AS t1\n",
    "LEFT JOIN gaiadr2.gaia_source AS t2\n",
    "  ON 1 = CONTAINS(POINT('ICRS', t1.ra, t1.dec), CIRCLE('ICRS', t2.ra, t2.dec));\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, the result will containt matches for every row in t1:\n",
    "- it will contain t1 rows without any matches\n",
    "- it can contain duplicated t1 rows if there are multiple matches to a single row in t1.\n"
